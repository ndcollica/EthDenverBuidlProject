## Integrate Web3Auth Core-Kit SDK in your Ethereum Application

### Description
In this challenge, your goal is to enable non-custodial social logins within your Ethereum application using the Web3Auth Core-Kit SDK.

Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.


### Acceptance Criteria
1. Read through what the Web3Auth Core-Kit SDK provides you compared to Plug and Play SDK: https://w3a.link/core-kit

2. Checkout the Web3Auth Core-Kit SDK Reference and understand how the SDK Integration Works: https://w3a.link/core-kit-sdk-reference

3. Use Aggregate Verifiers to combine multiple login methods to create a verifier to get the same address for your user: https://w3a.link/agg-verifier

4. Check out the example to help you get started with the integration: https://w3a.link/core-kit-example

5. Have a look at Ethereum Web3Auth Private Key Provider to know how to make blockchain calls: https://w3a.link/eth-pk-provider

6. Have a look at the Ethereum blockchain connection documentation for making RPC Calls: https://w3a.link/eth-doc

7. Finally, there is the web3auth core-kit guide available to help you quickly start: https://w3a.link/core-kit-guide

8. Better UX, additional features/ modules, and unique implementation are how we award more points ;)

9. If you have any questions regarding the integration, make sure to hit us up in the GitHub Discussions: https://w3a.link/gh-discussion
